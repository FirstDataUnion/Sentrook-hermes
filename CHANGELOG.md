# sentrook (Hermes plugin)

## 0.1.1-rc.1

- Internal: optional local JSONL diagnostic log for maintainers investigating
  review-card copy and scan decisions (off by default).

## 0.1.0-beta.3

- Keep provider prefixes when redacting secrets (`sk-ant-[REDACTED]`,
  `Bearer [REDACTED]`, webhook path) so hosted scan can still match
  secret-shaped rules without receiving key material.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

- Unexpected `pre_tool_call` errors and HTTP 200 bodies with missing/unknown
  `decision` (or invalid JSON) fail closed instead of allowing the tool.
- OIDC mint uses its own 30s budget; `/scan` then gets the full `timeout_ms`.
- Scan-error `rule_key` fingerprints the pending tool and args so Always Allow
  on a timeout cannot skip later timeouts of unrelated commands.
- Blocked (and denied) tool calls no longer linger in the session pending map.
- `webhook` and `homeassistant` are not treated as attended chat surfaces.
- Operator README: uninstall and privacy; configure wizard is production-only.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

- Closed beta line: hosted `/scan` with Hermes `approve` + `rule_key`,
  `hermes sentrook configure|verify`, PlanIR host-tool aliases, unattended/YOLO
  block, and auth never fail-open on 401/403.
